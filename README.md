# San-Francisco-Crime-Prediction
Artificial intelligence and Machine learning Project. <br>
The objective of this project was to predict the crimes that occurred in San Francisco in 2016. Different Machine Learning models were used: 
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree </li>	
	<li>Random Forest</li>
	<li>Logistic Regression</li>	
<li>Gaussian Naive Bayes</li>	
<li>XGboost	</li>
<li>	Multi-Layer Perceptron (1 layer, 2 layers, 3 layers)</li>	
</ul> <br>
GridSearchCV and BayesSearchCv hyperparameter tuning techniques were applied on the best models to minimize overfitting and find the differences between the two techniques. <br>
